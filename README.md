# 🌍 ProblemPulse  
**An AI-powered Problem Intelligence & Action Platform**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Global and local problems emerge every minute across news platforms, social media, public forums, and government channels. However, these issues remain scattered, complex, and difficult for the public and decision-makers to understand, prioritize, and act upon.

**ProblemPulse** is an AI-powered platform that detects emerging problems in real time, simplifies them into clear insights, visualizes their impact, and bridges the gap between awareness and action.

This project was built as part of a **national-level hackathon** with a focus on innovation, real-world impact, and scalability.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

There is no unified platform that:
- Detects emerging global and local problems in real time  
- Simplifies complex issues into understandable insights  
- Tracks their evolution and impact  
- Enables discussion, accountability, and solution-building  

ProblemPulse addresses this gap by acting as a **problem intelligence system**, not just an information aggregator.

---

## 💡 Solution

ProblemPulse continuously analyzes data from multiple public sources, applies AI-driven analysis, and presents problems in a structured, actionable format.

The platform enables:
- Early detection of critical issues  
- Clear understanding of root causes and impact  
- Stakeholder visibility and accountability  
- Community-driven and AI-assisted solutions
